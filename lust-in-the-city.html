    <h3>Chapter One: Backseat Confessions</h3>
    <p>Sitting in the back seat of the taxi, her thighs pressed tightly together as she bit her lower lip, hard. The city lights blurred outside the window, but her mind was sharper than everplaying reel after reel of the things she wanted Alex to do to her. Needed her to do.</p>
    <p>God, the things that woman could do with just a look.</p> 
    <p>They hadn’t even kissed yet, not properly. But the way Alex moved - calm, sure, and just a little recklesshad her melting with anticipation. Their connection was magnetic. Dangerous. And utterly addictive.</p>
    <p>Every stolen moment between them felt charged. Like something was about to snap. Every brush of fingers, every sidelong glance, every laugh that lasted a second too long made her body ache in places she didn’t know could ache. She was drunk off the memory of Alex’s voice, deep, velvet smooth, laced with suggestion. That voice had curled around her spine last Friday, wrapping her in heat.</p>
    <p>They had shared a bottle of red, yes, but it was Alex who made her dizzy.</p>
    <p>Alex leaned in close that night, whispering things right against her skin, letting her breath ghost over her neck like a promise. Her lips hadn’t touched her, but her words had. They crawled down her body, settled between her legs and stayed there, pulsing. She had trembled. Legs weak, mind a blur of lust and restraint. She remembered gripping her own thigh under the table, trying to ground herself.</p>
    <p>She wanted Alex to pull her hair back. Push her against the wall. Devour her.</p>
    <p>But instead, she played it cool. Talked about everything but the obvious. Blushed. Laughed. Looked away too much. God, she hated herself for that. She had come over for something more, something raw, something that didn’t need words. And still, she'd let the night end with only a hug and a long, loaded pause at the door.</p>
    <p>Now, stuck in the back of this cab, her body was practically vibrating with need. Her pulse throbbed between her legs with every passing thought. She adjusted her skirt, but the friction only made things worse.</p>
    <p>She let out a breath and muttered, barely above a whisper, “I just want her to fuck me already.”</p>
    <p>A shift in the rearview mirror caught her attention.</p>
    <p>The driver. Watching her. His eyes locked with hers.</p>
    <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
    <p>She narrowed her gaze. “Are you serious right now?” she hissed.</p>
    <p>The man quickly looked away, pretending to adjust his mirror.</p>
    <p>“Typical,” she spat under her breath. “Fucking men.”</p>
    <p>She turned her head back to the window, heart pounding, but not from him. From Alex. From everything she was going to let happen next time.</p>
    <p>Because next time, she wouldn't hesitate. Next time, she'd show up, lips parted and ready.</p>

    <h3>Chapter Two: Wine and Whispers</h3>
  <p>It was a Wednesday nightJune's favourite kind. A night to herself. No noise, no obligations. Just soft lights, her ridiculous but therapeutic skincare routine, and that feel good kind of silence that only came when you lived alone downtown.</p>

  <p>She’d just smeared on her green clay face maskthe one that made her look like Princess Fiona from <em>Shrek</em>and slipped under her duvet with a glass of wine, ready to binge her comfort series on Netflix, when her phone buzzed.</p>

  <p><strong>FaceTime. Alex.</strong></p>

  <p>She froze. Then sighed. “Of course.”</p>

  <p><img src="images/june-bedtime.jpg" alt="Woman in bed with face mask and wine" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>She answered. “Why are you calling me at almost midnight?”</p>

  <p>Alex was glowing through the screen, carefree. She had something funny to sharesome chaotic story from earlierand as she laughed, June couldn’t help noticing… Alex wasn’t wearing a bra.</p>

  <p>Her nipples pressed gently against her tank top, barely visible but absolutely there. And once June noticed, it was impossible to unsee. Her wine suddenly felt warmer. Her mouth, drier.</p>

  <p><img src="images/alex-facetime.jpg" alt="Facetime screen with soft-lit woman in tank top" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>Then came the question. Quiet. Straightforward.</p>

  <p>“Can you come over?”</p>

  <p>June blinked. “What?”</p>

  <p>“I don’t want to be alone tonight,” Alex said, softly. “I want… company. Yours.”</p>

  <p>June hesitated. Looked at the clock. Almost 12:30 a.m.</p>

  <p>She hung up.</p>

  <p>Not in rejectionbut in motion. She peeled off her mask, threw on a soft dress, and this timeshe didn’t call a cab.</p>

  <p>She grabbed her car keys. She didn’t feel safe with strange men driving her anymore. Not when she was vulnerable. Not tonight.</p>

  <p><img src="images/night-drive.jpg" alt="Woman driving through city at night" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>The drive was quiet. Her heart was louder than the music.</p>

  <p>Alex opened the door almost instantly, like she’d been waiting behind it the whole time.</p>

  <p>The lights were low. Candles flickered. A jazz record whispered through the flat. And thereon the tableanother bottle of wine, already breathing.</p>

  <p><img src="images/candles-wine.jpg" alt="Lit candles and wine glasses on table" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>“You came,” Alex said, smiling.</p>

  <p>“You said you’d wait.”</p>

  <p>They didn’t rush. They talked. Laughed. Let the candles burn lower.</p>

  <p>And eventually, when Alex leaned in and kissed herit wasn’t urgent. It was soft. Earnest. Their lips met slowly, like a song with no chorus, just harmony.</p>

  <p><img src="images/couch-kiss.jpg" alt="Silhouetted kiss in candlelight" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>They undressed each other like they were learning the story by touch.</p>

  <p>Every motion. Every sigh. Every lookit all felt new. Tender. Intentional.</p>

  <p>When June cameit was with her eyes open. With Alex watching her. With her hands holding her. With the music still playing low behind them and the candles flickering against the walls.</p>

  <p><img src="images/sheets-warm.jpg" alt="Tangled sheets, soft candlelight" class="responsive-img""></p>

  <p>They lay there. Tangled. Breathing. Satisfied but not finished.</p>

  <p>Alex pulled her close, lips brushing her temple. “This is what I meant when I said I didn’t want to be alone tonight.”</p>

  <p>June smiled against her skin. “Good. Because I’m not leaving anytime soon.”</p>
