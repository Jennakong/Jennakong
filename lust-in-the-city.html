      <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;" class="mt-5">Chapter One: Backseat Confessions</h2>
    <p>Sitting in the back seat of the taxi, her thighs pressed tightly together as she bit her lower lip, hard. The city lights blurred outside the window, but her mind was sharper than everplaying reel after reel of the things she wanted Alex to do to her. Needed her to do.</p>
    <p>God, the things that woman could do with just a look.</p> 
    <p>They hadn‚Äôt even kissed yet, not properly. But the way Alex moved - calm, sure, and just a little recklesshad her melting with anticipation. Their connection was magnetic. Dangerous. And utterly addictive.</p>
    <p>Every stolen moment between them felt charged. Like something was about to snap. Every brush of fingers, every sidelong glance, every laugh that lasted a second too long made her body ache in places she didn‚Äôt know could ache. She was drunk off the memory of Alex‚Äôs voice, deep, velvet smooth, laced with suggestion. That voice had curled around her spine last Friday, wrapping her in heat.</p>
    <p>They had shared a bottle of red, yes, but it was Alex who made her dizzy.</p>
    <p>Alex leaned in close that night, whispering things right against her skin, letting her breath ghost over her neck like a promise. Her lips hadn‚Äôt touched her, but her words had. They crawled down her body, settled between her legs and stayed there, pulsing. She had trembled. Legs weak, mind a blur of lust and restraint. She remembered gripping her own thigh under the table, trying to ground herself.</p>
    <p>She wanted Alex to pull her hair back. Push her against the wall. Devour her.</p>
    <p>But instead, she played it cool. Talked about everything but the obvious. Blushed. Laughed. Looked away too much. God, she hated herself for that. She had come over for something more, something raw, something that didn‚Äôt need words. And still, she'd let the night end with only a hug and a long, loaded pause at the door.</p>
    <p>Now, stuck in the back of this cab, her body was practically vibrating with need. Her pulse throbbed between her legs with every passing thought. She adjusted her skirt, but the friction only made things worse.</p>
    <p>She let out a breath and muttered, barely above a whisper, ‚ÄúI just want her to fuck me already.‚Äù</p>
    <p>A shift in the rearview mirror caught her attention.</p>
    <p>The driver. Watching her. His eyes locked with hers.</p>
    <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
    <p>She narrowed her gaze. ‚ÄúAre you serious right now?‚Äù she hissed.</p>
    <p>The man quickly looked away, pretending to adjust his mirror.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúTypical,‚Äù she spat under her breath. ‚ÄúFucking men.‚Äù</p>
    <p>She turned her head back to the window, heart pounding, but not from him. From Alex. From everything she was going to let happen next time.</p>
    <p>Because next time, she wouldn't hesitate. Next time, she'd show up, lips parted and ready.</p>

    <div id="chapter2">
      <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;" class="mt-5">Chapter Two: Wine and Whispers</h2>
<p>It was a cool Wednesday night, June‚Äôs favourite kind. A night to herself. No noise, no obligations. Just soft lights, her ridiculous but therapeutic skincare routine, and that feel good kind of silence that only came when you lived alone downtown. </p>

<p>She had just smeared on her green clay face mask, the one that made her look like Princess Fiona from Shrek - and slipped under her duvet with a glass of wine, ready to binge her comfort series on Netflix, when her phone buzzed. </p>
<p><img src="images/june-bedtime.jpg" alt="Woman in bed with face mask and wine"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>
<p>FaceTime. </p>

<p>Alex. </p>

<p>She froze for a second. </p>

<p>Ah. Of course. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy is this girl calling me at almost midnight?‚Äù she muttered to herself, then hesitantly accepted the call. </p>

<p>Alex‚Äôs face filled the screen, grinning like she wasn‚Äôt aware of the time. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI hope this isn‚Äôt urgent,‚Äù June said, raising an eyebrow, trying to sound stern‚Äîeven with green goo on her face. </p>

<p>Alex burst into laughter. ‚ÄúYou look mad!‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄùI look like money. What do you want?‚Äù </p>

<p>Alex had just come back from some chaotic hangout and was in storyteller mode, recounting a scene from the parking lot like it was a Netflix comedy special. June half-listened at first, sipping her wine. But slowly, as Alex spoke, her eyes wandered. The low-cut tank top. The way Alex‚Äôs collarbone caught the light. Her soft locs thrown to the. Her skin lit like caramel under the warm bulb overhead. And those lips. Those lips that moved so expressively with every word. </p>

<p>Then she noticed it. </p>
<p><img src="images/alex-facetime.jpg" alt="Facetime screen with soft-lit woman in tank top"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>
<p>As Alex's breast jiggled as she laughed. </p>

<p>Her nipples pressed against the fabric - subtle, but there. And once June noticed, she could not unsee it. She shifted under the covers. Something about watching her talk, so freely, so animatedly, made her chest feel tight‚Ä¶ and her thoughts spiral. </p>
<p>Alex tilted her head, still smiling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúReally? ‚ÄòCause your eyes are doing a madness.‚Äù </p>

<p>June looked away, flustered. Then she heard it: </p>

<p>‚ÄúCan you come over?‚Äù </p>

<p>June blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù </p>

<p>Alex said it again, softer this time. ‚ÄúCome over.‚Äù </p>

<p>There was a pause. Not long, but enough for a breath. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù June asked, half-laughing, half-holding her breath. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Alex said, voice dipping a little lower. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to be alone tonight. I want‚Ä¶ company. Yours.‚Äù </p>

<p>Silence again. </p>

<p>June looked at the time. Almost 12:30 a.m. </p>

<p>‚ÄúAlex, it‚Äôs late.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI know.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got Fiona on my face and wine in my bloodstream.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait.‚Äù </p>

<p>The line went quiet for a moment. Alex did not push. </p>

<p>June sighed, staring at the screen. She could say no. She should. But the truth was, she wanted to go. She wanted to be seen - not just virtually. To be near her. To be touched. And besides‚Ä¶ it was Alex. </p>

<p>She hung up. </p>

<p>Not to reject the call‚Äîbut to move. </p>

<p>She peeled off her mask, freshened up quickly, and instead of ordering a cab like usual, she grabbed her car keys. She did not feel safe with strange men driving her at night anymore. Not when she felt this vulnerable. Not tonight. </p>

<p>The drive was quiet. Her heartbeat louder than the radio.</p>
<p>She wore a simple black knit dress-easy, soft, and familiar. No makeup, no heels. Just perfume and nerves. </p>
  <p><img src="images/night-drive.jpg" alt="Woman driving through city at night"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>
<p>When she got to Alex‚Äôs building, she did not go in right away. She sat in the car for a moment, staring at her own reflection in the rearview. Her hands were sweating. Her mouth was dry. </p>

<p>But her body? Her body was already in motion. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs the wine!!! I'm just dehydrated - she thought to herself. </p>

<p>She took a breath, stepped out, and made her way up. </p>

<p>Alex opened the door instantly, like she had been waiting behind it the whole time. </p>

<p>The lights were low. A few candles lit on the sideboard. A record player in the corner hummed something jazzy and warm. There was another bottle of red wine breathing on the table, two glasses already poured. </p>
 
<p>‚ÄúYou came,‚Äù Alex whispered. </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd wait.‚Äù </p>
<p>They stood there for a second, no kiss, no hug. Just standing. Watching. Reading each other. Then Alex reached forward, brushed a strand of hair from June‚Äôs face, and kissed her forehead. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúYou want some wine?‚Äù </p>

<p>June nodded, stepping inside. </p>
<p>They talked. About nothing. And everything. The room was a little too warm. The wine a little too smooth. The way Alex looked at her made her skin tingle. </p>

<p>At one point, Alex shifted closer. Their knees touched. Her hand rested gently on June‚Äôs thigh. </p>
  <p><img src="images/candles-wine.jpg" alt="Lit candles and wine glasses on table"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this okay?‚Äù she asked. </p>

<p>June nodded. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù </p>

<p>Alex leaned in, slow. Not rushed. Their lips met, soft and cautious, as if checking for mutual permission with every breath. And when June sighed into her mouth, Alex deepened the kiss. </p>

<p>She didn‚Äôt push her down or drag her to the bedroom. She just pulled her gently, straddled her thighs, and kissed her again. Slower. Deeper. Her hands held June‚Äôs face like something sacred. </p>

<p>The music played low in the background. </p>

<p>Their kisses grew hungrier. </p>

<p>June tugged at the hem of Alex‚Äôs shorts. Alex smiled into her mouth. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI lit those candles for a reason,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúStay with me tonight.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI already am.‚Äù </p>

<p>They moved to the couch, still kissing. Alex reached behind her, slowly unzipping her dress, every motion deliberate. June‚Äôs hands ran over her bare back, feeling her warmth, her skin, her rhythm. </p>
<p>They didn‚Äôt rush, just undressed each other like a slow song, like every layer was a question and every touch an answer. </p>
 <p><img src="images/couch-kiss.jpg" alt="Silhouetted kiss in candlelight"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>
<p>And when their bodies finally met - skin to skin, it wasn‚Äôt just lust. </p>
<p>It was softness. </p>
<p>It was heat. </p>
<p>It was whispers in the dark and wine on their breath. </p>

<p>It was everything June did not know she was allowed to feel with a woman - tenderness, desire, safety, all at once. </p>

<p>And when she finally came, under Alex‚Äôs mouth, under her fingers, under her gaze - it was with her eyes wide open. </p>

<p>Alex watched her the whole time. </p>
  <p><img src="images/sheets-warm.jpg" alt="Tangled sheets, soft candlelight"  class="img-fluid responsive-img-500 mb-4"></p>

  <p>They lay there. Tangled. Breathing. Satisfied but not finished. </p>

  <p>Alex pulled her close, lips brushing her temple. ‚ÄúThis is what I meant when I said I didn‚Äôt want to be alone tonight.‚Äù</p>

  <p>June smiled against her skin. ‚ÄúGood. Because I am not leaving anytime soon.‚Äù</p>
