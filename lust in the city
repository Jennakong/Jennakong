    <h3>Chapter One: Backseat Confessions</h3>
    <p>Sitting in the back seat of the taxi, her thighs pressed tightly together as she bit her lower lip, hard. The city lights blurred outside the window, but her mind was sharper than ever—playing reel after reel of the things she wanted Alex to do to her. Needed her to do.</p>
    <p>God, the things that woman could do with just a look.</p>
    <p>They hadn’t even kissed yet, not properly. But the way Alex moved—calm, sure, and just a little reckless—had her melting with anticipation. Their connection was magnetic. Dangerous. And utterly addictive.</p>
    <p>Every stolen moment between them felt charged. Like something was about to snap. Every brush of fingers, every sidelong glance, every laugh that lasted a second too long made her body ache in places she didn’t know could ache. She was drunk off the memory of Alex’s voice—deep, velvet smooth, laced with suggestion. That voice had curled around her spine last Friday, wrapping her in heat.</p>
    <p>They had shared a bottle of red, yes, but it was Alex who made her dizzy.</p>
    <p>Alex leaned in close that night, whispering things right against her skin, letting her breath ghost over her neck like a promise. Her lips hadn’t touched her, but her words had. They crawled down her body, settled between her legs and stayed there, pulsing. She had trembled—legs weak, mind a blur of lust and restraint. She remembered gripping her own thigh under the table, trying to ground herself.</p>
    <p>She wanted Alex to pull her hair back. Push her against the wall. Devour her.</p>
    <p>But instead, she played it cool. Talked about everything but the obvious. Blushed. Laughed. Looked away too much. God, she hated herself for that. She had come over for something more—something raw, something that didn’t need words. And still, she'd let the night end with only a hug and a long, loaded pause at the door.</p>
    <p>Now, stuck in the back of this cab, her body was practically vibrating with need. Her pulse throbbed between her legs with every passing thought. She adjusted her skirt, but the friction only made things worse.</p>
    <p>She let out a breath and muttered, barely above a whisper, “I just want her to fuck me already.”</p>
    <p>A shift in the rearview mirror caught her attention.</p>
    <p>The driver. Watching her. His eyes locked with hers.</p>
    <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
    <p>She narrowed her gaze. “Are you serious right now?” she hissed.</p>
    <p>The man quickly looked away, pretending to adjust his mirror.</p>
    <p>“Typical,” she spat under her breath. “Fucking men.”</p>
    <p>She turned her head back to the window, heart pounding—but not from him. From Alex. From everything she was going to let happen next time.</p>
    <p>Because next time, she wouldn't hesitate. Next time, she'd show up, lips parted and ready.</p>
