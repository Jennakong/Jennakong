  <h1>Jesus Lives in My House</h1>
  <p>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning. – Isaiah 58:8</p>
</section>

<section class="content">

  <p>It’s 6:54 a.m.  
  And I can see the sun.</p>

  <p>It had not visited my window in such clarity in many days.  
  But today — on the 1st of April — it came.  
  Golden. Gentle. Unbothered.  
  As if to say, “You made it.”</p>

  <p>Most people wouldn’t notice such a thing.  
  But I did.  
  Because this light wasn’t just weather. It was a sign.</p>

  <p>You might wonder, why would something so simple matter to a girl like me?  
  Well, I’ll take you back to how it all started.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder1.jpg" alt="Sunrise moment" />

  <p>On the 1st of January, I decided it was time to walk away from a habit I had carried for a decade.  
  I told God, “Take all of it — not just the pieces I’ve handed you before.”</p>

  <p>Now, don’t get me wrong — I’ve always known He’s been the owner of my life.  
  But if I’m being honest, I lived like I was in control.  
  Like I owned my life and He was just managing it from time to time.</p>

  <p>It doesn’t even make sense when I say it out loud.  
  But I was living my own way.  
  On the surface, things looked fine.  
  But inside? I was drained. Something was missing.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder2.jpg" alt="Surrender moment" />

  <p>I missed the girl I used to be.  
  That girl who, a decade ago, was still just a teenager —  
  Innocent. Vulnerable. At peace with God.  
  I remembered her. And I missed her.</p>

  <p>Somewhere along the way, I needed more.  
  And in the search for “more,” I got lost.</p>

  <p>But on January 1st, I broke.  
  I cried my eyes out.  
  I poured out my heart.  
  And I asked God to come back into my life — not as a guest, but as the Author.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder3.jpg" alt="Bible and tears" />

  <p>Here’s the twist: the first quarter of the year tested me in ways I never imagined.</p>

  <p>I lost jobs. I lost money. I lost people dear to me.  
  And I was tempted — over and over again — to run back to the comfort of the habit I promised to leave.</p>

  <p>That thing that never brought peace, only more anxiety.</p>

  <p>But through the storm… I saw Him.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder4.jpg" alt="Storms and faith" />

  <p>I saw Him in the smallest details.  
  I saw Him when I cried.  
  I saw Him when I opened my Bible to “random” pages — only to find words that felt handwritten for me.  
  I felt Him in the silence.  
  I saw Him when I was completely alone.</p>

  <p>I saw the God who sees me.  
  <strong>EL ROI.</strong></p>

  <img src="images/placeholder5.jpg" alt="Light breaking through window" />

  <p>And today — 90 days sober — I woke up and saw the sun.  
  At exactly 6:54 a.m., the light came pouring through my window.  
  And I knew… this was more than just a sunrise.  
  It was a sign.  
  A reminder.</p>

  <p><strong>My light has come. A new dawn is here.</strong></p>

  <img src="images/placeholder6.jpg" alt="New dawn" />

  <p>If you don’t believe it, just look at me.  
  You’ll see Him in the details.  
  You’ll see Him in the light.  
  You’ll see Him in the healing.</p>

  <p>Because today — and every day forward —  
  <strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>
