<section class="content">

  <p>It’s 6:54 a.m. And I can see the sun.</p>
  <p>It had not visited my window in such clarity in many days. But today — on the 1st of April — it came. Golden. Gentle. Unbothered. As if to say, “You made it.”</p>
  <p>Most people wouldn’t notice such a thing. But I did. Because this light wasn’t just weather. It was a sign.</p>

  <p>On the 1st of January, I decided it was time to walk away from a habit I had carried for a decade. I told God, “Take all of it — not just the pieces I’ve handed you before.”</p>
  <p>I’ve always known He’s been the owner of my life. But if I’m being honest, I lived like I was in control. Like I owned my life and He was just managing it from time to time.</p>
  <p>It doesn’t even make sense when I say it out loud. But I was living my own way. On the surface, things looked fine. But inside? I was drained. Something was missing.</p>

  <p>That morning, while it was still dark, I stood by the window — the same window I’m looking out of today.</p>
  <p>I held the last of it in my hands. The stash. The papers. The lighter.</p>
  <p>The things I used to reach for when I was tired, anxious, or overwhelmed. But this time, I didn’t light it.</p>
  <p>The same hands that used to roll up were now releasing. Throwing it all away. And as I did, I prayed. I cried. Not just for strength — but for a new beginning.</p>
  <p>I asked God to take not just the tools — but the taste. The desire. The weight of the cycle I kept falling into.</p>
  <p>I knew it wasn’t something He could do for me. It had to start with a choice. And that morning, I chose Him.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder2.jpg" alt="Window and moment of release" />

  <p>The first quarter of the year tested me in ways I never imagined. I lost jobs. I lost money. I lost people dear to me. And I was tempted — over and over again — to run back to the comfort of the habit I promised to leave.</p>
  <p>That thing that never brought peace, only more anxiety. But through the storm… I saw Him.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder3.jpg" alt="Storms and faith" />

  <p>I saw Him in the smallest details. I saw Him when I cried. I saw Him when I opened my Bible to “random” pages — only to find words that felt handwritten for me. I felt Him in the silence. I saw Him when I was completely alone.</p>
  <p>I saw the God who sees me. <strong>EL ROI.</strong></p>

  <p>“Then shall thy light break forth as the morning...”</p>

  <p>Jesus lives in my house. You see Him when you look at me. You see Him in the light. You see Him in the healing. Jesus lives in my house. And heaven is just a mile away from here.</p>
