  <h1>Jesus Lives in My House</h1>
  <p>“Then shall thy light break forth as the morning...”</p>
</section>

<section class="content">

  <p>It’s 6:54 a.m. And I can see the sun.</p>
  <p>It had not visited my window in such clarity in many days. But today — on the 1st of April — it came. Golden. Gentle. Unbothered. As if to say, “You made it.”</p>
  <p>Most people wouldn’t notice such a thing. But I did. Because this light wasn’t just weather. It was a sign.</p>

<h3>Letting Go</h3>
  <p>On the 1st of January, I decided it was time to walk away from a habit I had carried for a decade. I told God, “Take all of it — not just the pieces I’ve handed you before.”</p>
  <p>I’ve always known He’s been the owner of my life. But if I’m being honest, I lived like I was in control. Like I owned my life and He was just managing it from time to time.</p>
  <p>It doesn’t even make sense when I say it out loud. But I was living my own way. On the surface, things looked fine. But inside? I was drained. Something was missing.</p>

  <p>That morning, while it was still dark, I stood by the window — the same window I’m looking out of today.</p>
  <p>I held the last of it in my hands. The stash. The papers. The lighter.</p>
  <p>The things I used to reach for when I was tired, anxious, or overwhelmed. But this time, I didn’t light it.</p>
  <p>The same hands that used to roll up were now releasing. Throwing it all away. And as I did, I prayed. I cried. Not just for strength — but for a new beginning.</p>
  <p>I asked God to take not just the tools — but the taste. The desire. The weight of the cycle I kept falling into.</p>
  <p>I knew it wasn’t something He could do for me. It had to start with a choice. And that morning, I chose Him.</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder2.png" alt="Window and moment of release" />
<p>Don’t get me wrong — we all have different paths, and different reasons why we turn to certain things.  
But I knew, for me, it had to stop.  
I needed clarity. I needed peace. I needed a sound mind — not just to function, but to be fully present in the purpose God has for me.</p>

<p>I had done life with Him before… but this time, I wanted to go deeper.  
I couldn’t keep saying He was the owner of my life while still being ruled by my own desires.  
It became hard to pray.  
And when anxiety hit, I didn’t run to God — I ran to something else.</p>

<p>And the truth is… that became its own form of worship.  
But my God is a jealous God.  
He wanted all of me.  
And I wanted all of Him.</p>

<p>So I gave Him my full attention — and in return, He gave me Himself.</p>

 <h3>Then Came The Rain</h3>
 <p>The first quarter of the year tested me in ways I never imagined. I lost jobs. I lost money. I lost people dear to me. And I was tempted — over and over again — to run back to the comfort of the habit I promised to leave.</p>
  <p>That thing that never brought peace, only more anxiety. But through the storm… I saw Him.</p>

  <p>I saw Him in the smallest details. I saw Him when I cried. I saw Him when I opened my Bible to “random” pages — only to find words that felt handwritten for me. I felt Him in the silence. I saw Him when I was completely alone.</p>
  <p>I saw the God who sees me. <strong>EL ROI.</strong></p>

<h3>A New Dawn</h3>
<p>And today — 90 days clean — I woke up and saw the sun.</p>
<p>At exactly 6:54 a.m.</p>
<p>And I knew.<br>
It wasn’t just another morning.<br>
It was confirmation.<br>
My light has come.<br>
A new dawn is here.</p>


<h3>Jesus Lives in My House</h3>
<p>If you don’t believe it, just look at me.</p>
<p>Look at the girl who came back.<br>
Look at the light breaking through her windows.<br>
Look at the peace that no habit ever gave her.</p>
<p>You’ll see Him.</p>
<p>You’ll see Jesus.<br>
Because now, more than ever…<br>
Jesus lives in my house. And heaven is just a mile away from here</p>
