  <h1>Jesus Lives in My House</h1>
  <p>“Then shall thy light break forth as the morning...” — Isaiah 58:8</p>
</section>

<section class="content">

  <p>It’s 6:54 a.m.  
  And I can see the sun.</p>

  <p>It had not visited my window in such clarity in many days.  
  But today — on the 1st of April — it came.  
  Golden. Gentle. Unbothered.  
  *As if to say, “You made it.”*</p>

  <p>Most people wouldn’t notice such a thing.  
  But I did.  
  Because this light wasn’t just weather. *It was a sign.*</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder1.jpg" alt="Sunrise moment" />

  <p>On the 1st of January, I decided it was time to walk away from a habit I had carried for a decade.  
  I told God, “Take all of it — not just the pieces I’ve handed you before.”</p>

  <p>Now, don’t get me wrong — I’ve always known He’s been the owner of my life.  
  But if I’m being honest, I lived like I was in control.  
  Like I owned my life and He was just managing it from time to time.</p>

  <p>It doesn’t even make sense when I say it out loud.  
  But I was living my own way.  
  On the surface, things looked fine.  
  But inside? I was drained. Something was missing.</p>

  <p>That morning, while it was still dark, I stood by the window — *the same window I’m looking out of today.*</p>

  <p>I held the last of it in my hands.  
  The stash.  
  The papers.  
  The lighter.</p>

  <p>The things I used to reach for when I was tired, anxious, or overwhelmed.  
  But this time, *I didn’t light it.*</p>

  <p>The same hands that used to roll up were now releasing.  
  Throwing it all away.  
  And as I did, *I prayed. I cried.*  
  Not just for strength — but for a new beginning.</p>

  <p>I asked God to take not just the tools — but the taste.  
  The desire.  
  The weight of the cycle I kept falling into.</p>

  <p>I knew it wasn’t something He could do for me.  
  It had to start with a choice.  
  And that morning, *I chose Him.*</p>

  <pre class="testimony">
Don’t get me wrong — we all have different experiences, and different reasons why we do the things we do.  
But I knew I needed to quit this habit because I needed clarity.  
I needed a free mind. A sound mind.  
I needed to think, to be still, to fully immerse myself in the purpose God has for me.

And while I’ve still been walking in that purpose over the years,  
I knew I could go deeper if I gave myself to Him fully.

Truth is — I wasn’t fully with Him when I was living in my own desires.  
It became hard to pray.  
And when I was anxious, instead of going to God, I went to a thing.  

And it may not look like it to everyone else,  
but that’s a form of worship.  
And my God… *my God is a jealous God.*  
He needed my full attention.

So I gave Him mine.  
And in return, He gave me Himself.

Everything else can wait.  
All I wanted was, “Give me You, Lord.”  
And *I got it.*  
*I love it here.*
  </pre>

  <p>The first quarter of the year tested me in ways I never imagined.</p>

  <p>I lost jobs. I lost money. I lost people dear to me.  
  And I was tempted — over and over again — to run back to the comfort of the habit I promised to leave.</p>

  <p>That thing that never brought peace, only more anxiety.</p>

  <p>But through the storm… *I saw Him.*</p>

  <img src="images/placeholder3.jpg" alt="Storms and faith" />

  <p>I saw Him in the smallest details.  
  I saw Him when I cried.  
  I saw Him when I opened my Bible to “random” pages — only to find words that felt handwritten for me.  
  I felt Him in the silence.  
  I saw Him when I was completely alone.</p>

  <p>*I saw the God who sees me.*  
  <strong>EL ROI.</strong></p>

  <img src="images/placeholder4.jpg" alt="Light breaking through window" />

  <p>And today — *90 days clean* — I woke up and saw the sun.  
  At exactly 6:54 a.m., the light came pouring through my window.  
  And I knew… this was more than just a sunrise.  
  *It was a sign.  
  A reminder.*</p>

  <pre class="scripture">
“Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,  
and thy health shall spring forth speedily,  
and thy righteousness shall go before thee;  
the glory of the Lord shall be thy rear guard.”  
— Isaiah 58:8
  </pre>

  <p>If you don’t believe it, just look at me.  
  You’ll see Him in the details.  
  You’ll see Him in the light.  
  You’ll see Him in the healing.</p>

  <p>Because today — and every day forward —  
  <strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t believe it… that’s okay.  
But just look at me — you’ll see Him in the details.  
You’ll see Him in the light.  
You’ll see Him in the healing.</p>

<p>Because today — and every day forward —  
<strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>

<p><em>And if you still don’t believe it — maybe just listen...</em></p>

<p><strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t believe it… that’s okay.  
But just look at me — you’ll see Him in the details.  
You’ll see Him in the light.  
You’ll see Him in the healing.</p>

<p>Because today — and every day forward —  
<strong>Jesus lives in my house.</strong></p>

<p><em>And if you still don’t believe it — maybe just listen...</em></p>
